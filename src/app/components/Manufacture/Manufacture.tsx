          The process starts during the design phase of a new product. A list is
          drawn up of the stresses that the watch is likely to have to
          withstand. Purely virtual and based on a product-use scenario, this
          first step provides a broad overview of the risks, which are then
          organized into the order in which the issues should be approached.
          Simulations can then be programmed.
